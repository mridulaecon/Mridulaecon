      <dt>Targeting Inflation Expectations? <h5> Job Market Paper </h5> </dt> 
        <dd>
      <p> <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
Do inflation expectations respond to changes in monetary policy? Subjective ex- pectations and an event study methodology are used to find that countries with a single mandate have a reduction in short run forecast errors. However, the adjust- ment in forecast errors does not come from an adjustment in inflation expectations but an adjustment in inflation. Thus, the key insight of the paper is that inflation targeting does not have a direct impact on short-run inflation expectations but an in- direct effect through inflation as a result of learning by the agents. Finally, the paper also performs a quantitative exercise which finds that the weight that agents attach to the inflation target is small. </p>

          <p> <strong>Abstract:</strong> Extending the model proposed by Barro and Gordon (1983) by introducing an independent central bank, subjective expectations, and announced intermediate inflation targets this paper aims to explain the disinflation process adopted by the Latin American economies. Specifically, given the introduction of a new independent central bank we ask if the policy of the announced intermediate targets were cheap talk or the targets aided the disinflation process. We hypothesise that announcing intermediate targets reduced the cost of disinflation by reducing the inflation surprises the agents face and enabling agents to learn faster. The reduced surprises also help in developing credibility for the central bank further building the basis for faster learning. Finally, we also show that the cost of disinflation reduces when there are announced inflation targets.</p>
